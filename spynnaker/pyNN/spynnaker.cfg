network_graph_format = None
@network_graph_format = Format to use to [draw](write_network_graph) a large graph
    Unless specified [draw](write_network_graph) is disabled for large graphs
    For small graph the [default format](path_network_graph) is used

n_profile_samples = 0
@n_profile_samples = Set to > 0 to allow profiler to gather samples (assuming enabled in the compiled aplx)

write_expander_iobuf = Debug
@write_expander_iobuf = Reads and writes the iobuff from the onchip synapse expander.
  Will be written with [System iobuff](path_iobuf_system)

@ = The section covers settings which control how the models behave.

spikes_per_second = 30
@spikes_per_second = Maximum spikes per second of any neuron (spike rate in Hertz)
   Used by all neurons that need this for planning, unless a different value is provided.

ring_buffer_sigma = 5
@ring_buffer_sigma = The number of standard deviations from the mean to account for in
   the ring buffer in terms of how much safety in precision vs overflowing the
   end user is willing to risk

incoming_spike_buffer_size = 256
@incoming_spike_buffer_size = The amount of space to reserve for incoming spikes

drop_late_spikes = False
@drop_late_spikes = performance limiter to throw away packets not processed in a given time step

transfer_overhead_clocks = 200
@transfer_overhead_clocks = The overhead to add to the transfer clocks
  when using a split synapse neuron model

n_colour_bits = 4
@n_colour_bits = The number of "colour" bits to use by default.  This is used to account for
  delays over the network that are bigger than 1 time step

error_on_non_spynnaker_pynn = True
@error_on_non_spynnaker_pynn = Whether to error or just warn on non-spynnaker-compatible PyNN

[Mode]
violate_1ms_wall_clock_restriction = False
@violate_1ms_wall_clock_restriction = Used if [time_step](simulation_time_step) * (timescale)[time_scale_factor] < 1000 as this may result in errors.

delay_support_adder = DelaySupportAdder
@delay_support_adder = Algorthm for adding Delay verteices.</br>
    Currently supported options:
    * DelaySupportAdder: Adds the standard Delays Vertcies if needed
    * None: will skip the adder (Not Recommended) </br></br>
