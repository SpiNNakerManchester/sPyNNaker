These are all the integration tests.

The quick_test directory are those that can be run relatively quickly.

The long_test directory are longer/larger versions of the quick tests.
These are used to test scale and will normally be run every time after the quick ones.

The manual_test directory are useful tests but are often larger version of the ones above and do not need to be run each time.

The x_test directory is tests which are marked to be removed.

All other directories are being reviewed
If they are not moved they are not run and risk being removed forever.
