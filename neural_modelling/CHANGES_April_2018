The c code has been changed in the following ways

1. Many c and h files have been moved.
    in most cases to a src folder next to their original location.

2. src subfolder level under neuron has been removed
    neuron/src/... files and directories are just neuron/...
    for example sPyNNaker/neural_modelling/src/spike_source/poisson/Makefile
        is now sPyNNaker/neural_modelling/spike_source/poisson/Makefile

3. All the indirect relative includes .. patterns have been replaced with <xyz> includes
3a. Some h files have been moved up to either
    neural_modelling/neuron or
    neural_modelling/neuron/plasticy
3b. Make files have been updated to add extra -I flags to find these includes
3c. The only "xyz" includes should be for direct sibling files

4. neuron/structural_plasticity/synaptogenesis/topographic_map_impl.c has been changed.
The DMA_WRITEBACK method has been removed. (code hardlined in where needed)
This because the log_error(  convertor can only handle direct Strings not parameters)

5. neural_modelling/src/neuron/builds/ are now neural_modelling/neuron_make_files/

6. The paths in the neuron make files should now be relative to
        sPyNNaker/neural_modelling/neuron
    -these included NEURON_MODE, NEURON_MODEL_H, INPUT_TYPE_H,
        THRESHOLD_TYPE_H, SYNAPSE_TYPE_H, SYNAPSE_DYNAMICS, TIMING_DEPENDENCE,
        TIMING_DEPENDENCE_H, WEIGHT_DEPENDENCE and WEIGHT_DEPENDENCE_H
    -for example NEURON_MODEL = $(SOURCE_DIR)/neuron/models/neuron_model_lif_impl.c
        is now just NEURON_MODEL = models/neuron_model_lif_impl.c
    -They will automatically be converted
        placed in sPyNNaker/neural_modelling/neuron_modifed and built from there

7. shared makefiles have been simplified
    (More verbose but hopefully easier to understand)
    -multipe files have been combined
    -define rules have been replaced by explicit ones
    -Variable defintion is done as late as possible
    -FrontEndCommonx.mk is no longer used
        -replaced by local.mk for non neuron builds
        -merged into neural_build.mk for neuron builds
