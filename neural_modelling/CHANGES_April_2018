The c code has been changed in the following ways

1. Many c and h files have been moved.
    in most cases to a src folder next to their originakl location.

2. neuron/src/... files and directories are jsut neuron/...

3. All the indirect relative includes .. patterns have been replaced with <xyz> includes
3a. Some h files have been moved up to either neuron or neuron/plasticy
3b. Make files have been updated to add extra -I flags to find these includes
3c. The only "xyz" includes should be for direct sibling files

4. neuron/structural_plasticity/synaptogenesis/topographic_map_impl.c has been changed.
The DMA_WRITEBACK method has been removed. (code hardlined in where needed)
This because the log_error(  convertor can only handle direct Strings not parameters)

5. neural_modelling/src/neuron/builds/ are now neural_modelling/neuron_make_files/

6. makefiles have been simplified
