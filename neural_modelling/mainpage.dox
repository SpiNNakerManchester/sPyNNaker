* @mainpage sPyNNaker: A PyNN Implementation for SpiNNaker
*
* @section intro Introduction
*
* sPyNNaker is an implementation of the
* [PyNN](https://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/)
* language for SpiNNaker that lets you build spiking neural networks and
* simulate them in real-time or close to real-time, depending on network
* complexity and system configuration.
*
* This is the documentation of the part of sPyNNaker, implemented in C, that
* is actually deployed onto SpiNNaker to execute. The
* [Python parts](http://spinnakermanchester.github.io/sPyNNaker/python/)
* of the sPyNNaker package are responsible for the user interface, data
* preparation, execution planning, and runtime control.
*
* Note that this code depends on
* [SpiNNFrontEndCommon](http://spinnakermanchester.github.io/SpiNNFrontEndCommon/c/)
* for many support functions.
*
* @section neuron Neuron Simulation Implementation
*
* The major part of this code is the implementation of the neuron simulator
* itself, which is comprised of several pieces.
*
* * A main entry point, c_main.c
* * The core neuron implementation, neuron.c
* * The core synapse implementation, synapses.c
* * The main spike processing system, spike_processing.c
* * The master population table, used to decode a spike and identify which
*   neurons it is to be delivered to, population_table.h
* * The neuron models, neuron_model.h, and subclasses
* * The synaptic input types, input_type.h, and subclasses
* * The synaptic shaping, synapse_types.h, and subclasses
* * The neural threshold model, threshold_type.h, and subclasses
* * The plasticity models, both for STDP (synapse_dynamics_stdp_mad_impl.c) and
*   structural plasticity (topographic_map_impl.c)
* * The additional model inputs, such as calcium ion modulation
*   (additional_input_ca2_adaptive_impl.h)
*
* @section support Support Binaries
*
* These enable the neuron simulation to work, or to work more efficiently.
*
* * Bitfield Expander, which builds inter-core message masks on the machine.
*   See bit_field_expander.c
* * Delay Extension, which handles messages that need to be delayed a long time
*   before delivery. See delay_extension.c
* * Robot Motor Control, which translates spiking rates of SpiNNaker messages
*   into activation levels for an motor device (part of integrating with
*   external peripherals). See robot_motor_control.c
* * Poisson Spike Source, which injects random spikes (using a Poisson
*   distribution) into the system. See spike_source_poisson.c
* * Synapse Expander, which efficiently constructs synaptic connectivity data
*   on machine from statistical descriptions. (Note that literal descriptions
*   of connectivity data need to be uploaded directly, which can be a slow
*   process by comparison to generating the data in parallel on SpiNNaker.)
*   See synapse_expander.c
* * Delay Expander, which efficiently constructs synaptic delay data on
*   machine. This is a reduced versino of the synapse expander that is designed
*   to support delay extensions. See delay_expander.c
