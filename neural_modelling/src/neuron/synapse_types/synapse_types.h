 *  \brief interface for different types of synapse shaping.
 *
 *  \details    The API includes:
 *
 *     - synapse_types_get_input_buffer_index (synapse_type_index, neuron_index):
 *         helper method which returns the buffer index to which a given type
 *         of synapses are stored for a given neuron being simulated by the
 *         model.
 *     - synapse_types_shape_input(*input_buffers, neuron_index,  parameters):
 *     	   decays the stuff thats sitting in the input buffers (to compensate
 *     	   for the valve behaviour of a synapse in biology (spike goes in,
 *     	   synapse opens, then closes slowly)). as these have not yet been
 *     	   processed and applied to the neuron.
 *     - synapse_types_add_neuron_input(*input_buffers, synapse_type_index,
 *                                      neuron_index, parameters, input):
 *         adds the inputs for a give timer period to a given neuron that is
 *          being simulated by this model
 *     - synapse_types_get_excitatory_input (input_buffers, neuron_index)
 *          extracts the excitatory input buffers from the buffers available
 *           for a given neuron id
 *
 *     - synapse_types_get_inhibitory_input (input_buffers, neuron_index)
 *           extracts the inhibitory input buffers from the buffers available
 *           for a given neuron id
 *
 *     - synapse_types_get_type_char (synapse_type_index)
 *           returns a human readable character for the type of synapse.
 *           examples would be X = excitatory types, I = inhibitory types etc
 *           etc.
 *
 *     - synapse_types_print_input (input_buffers, neuron_index):
 *        prints the input for a neuron id given the available inputs currently
 *        only executed when the models are in debug mode, as the prints are
 *        controlled from the synapses.c _print_inputs method.
 * interface for all types of synapses shaping functions.
