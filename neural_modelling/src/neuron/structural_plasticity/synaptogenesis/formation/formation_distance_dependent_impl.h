//! \brief Configuration of synapse formation rule
//!
//! Describes the size of grid containing the neurons (the total number of
//! neurons probably ought to be equal to or just a bit under \a grid_x &times;
//! \a grid_y), and two tables of distance-dependent connection probabilities.
//! The FF table describes ??? connection probabilities, and the LAT table
//! describes lateral connection probabilities. Both are keyed by the _square_
//! of the inter-neuron distance.
//!
//! Note that both pre- and post-neurons are assumed to be on the same size of
//! grid, and the inter-layer distance is assumed to be constant (so it can be
//! accounted for in the construction of the tables).
